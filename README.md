# FireSat

This is a description of a FireSat mission design expressed as OWL ontology files (in `ttl` format).

Notice that the OWL files are in the folder `src/owl` and organized in subfolders based on their namespaces.

The file `src/owl/catalog.xml` contains a mapping between the files' logical namespaces and thier physical locations.

While most of the files represent *assertions*, i.e., asserted facts, those in folder `src/owl/opencaesar.io/examples/firesat/bundle` represent *entailments* generated by a DL (Description Logic) reasoner from the assertions.

The folder `src/sparq` contains some examples of SPARQL queries that can be run against this dataset. You can write others by adding more *.sparql files in the same folder.

A `build.gradle` script is added with some convenient tools to work with Fuseki as can be seen below.

## Clone
```
  git clone https://github.com/melaasar/firesat.git
  cd firesat
```
## Prerequisites

- You need JDK 11+ installed in the environment

## Quick Start
Run the following
```
./gradlew startFuseki
./gradlew query
./gradlew stopFuseki
``` 
Inspect results of query in folder: `build/results` 

## Start Fuseki Server
Start a new Fuseki instance if one is not already started
```
./gradlew startFuseki
```
A Fuseki instance can now be accessed at URL: http://localhost:3030

> You need to run this once at the start before running any action (like load or query) involving Fuseki

## Stop Fuseki Server
Stop a running Fuseki instance if one is already running
```
./gradlew stopFuseki
```

> You need to run this once at the end after you are done running actions (like load or query) involving Fuseki

## Load Dataset
> Pre-req: A Fuseki server with a firesat dataset must be running at http://localhost:3030/firesat (see Start Fuseki Server below)  

Load a dataset to a running Fuseki instance
```
./gradlew load
```

## Query Dataset
>Pre-req: A Fuseki server with a firesat dataset must be running at http://localhost:3030/firesat (see Start Fuseki Server below)  

Run SPARQL queries in `src/sparql` on a dataset loaded in Fuseki
```
./gradlew query
```
Results will be in the folder `build/results`
